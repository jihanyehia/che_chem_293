What does the model achieve?
The model shows a linear regression between the hours spent to prepare for a test and the test score.


How should metrics be interpreted?
The slope (5.250) means that the test score can be improved 5.250 times with additional hours of study.
The Y-intercept (67.16) represents the test score expected with zero hours of study. 


What are appropriate use cases?
Any case having two variables that are expected to be linearly related:
food intake and obesity, smoking and lung cancer, ...


How is it implemented? *
It determines the best regression line by minimizing the squared difference between the line and the actual data points.


What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
More than 20 data points may improve the accuracy of the model.


How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
Test scores are correlated with study hours. More hours of study can generally improve the test score.
